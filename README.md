# looping_thing
Playing around with the audiobuffer thing to make audios loop for real.
This started with the question "can i make audios loop with no gaps on the browser?" -yes, you can.
Then added volume, pan, the wafeform view, loop range, etc, and the posibility of adding your own tracks (which are not uploaded anywhere).
This is useful for rehearsing on top of a multitrack, removing the intrument you're playing, or simply making a new mix.

# TODO:
 * save mixes on the localstorage and download them as json
